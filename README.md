# Mediakeys
Don't have any physical media keys (pause/resume, previous, next) on your keyboard?

This [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script makes them work on a standard keyboard.


To get this to work you need to download and install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/)
Download the Mediakeys.ahk, right click Mediakeys.ahk and press Run Script. 

Now Ctrl+Alt+Left+Arrow/Down Arrow/Right Arrow should let you go to the previous track/pause or resume the track/ go to the next track.
